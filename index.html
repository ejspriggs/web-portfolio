            This page is a class assignment in the style of a portfolio site,
            and will eventually actually be used as such a site, once future
            work has made it fit for that purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
            The "Bio" option from the nav bar above will replace the content
            here with a short biography, via changing the CSS "display" setting
            for the sections in JavaScript.  "Home" will bring back this
            landing/explanation page.
        </p>
        <p>
            The "Resume" option is a link to my resume in PDF format.
        </p>
        <p>
            The "Projects" and "Themes" options are CSS drop-down menus
            implemented using the hover pseudoclass.  "Projects" has a link
            to a tic-tac-toe game implemented as a separate page, and a
            placeholder link to an improved version of the same game that
            is a stretch goal for this assignment.  "Themes" is a theme
            switcher, currently offering light and dark flavors.  It is
            implemented by using class-scoped CSS variable definitions to
            define the colors for this page, and JavaScript to change the
            class assigned to the "body" element in response to menu selections.
        </p>
        <p>
            The footer contains some possibly-useful links.

            I've loved computers since I was a kid.  Some of what I know is
            from then, and some is new.  I enjoy cooking as a hobby.
