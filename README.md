The "Projects" drop-down links to tic-tac-toe, and has a placeholder link for the stretch version of it.  Drop-downs are implemented using the strategy described here: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_dropdown.asp , and screenshots are taken for the present document using the ":hover" pseudoclass forcing option in the Firefox debugger.

The "Themes" drop-down implements a theme-switcher in JavaScript, using the variable-scope-based strategy described here: https://medium.com/@haxzie/dark-and-light-theme-switcher-using-css-variables-and-pure-javascript-zocada-dd0059d72fa2

Tic-tac-toe, with the player's choice of mark, and a game results/play again function.  Both of the latter are implemented in a modal.  SVG glyphs are my own work, and were handwritten in XML.

# User stories
- As a friend of Edward, I'm curious about why he's been so busy lately and/or want to gas him up about something he's put time into.
- As a hiring manager, I want to see if this Spriggs guy is any good at web pages.
- As someone interested in playing games in a web browser, I have encountered a link to one of Edward's portfolio projects in the wild, and I want to play the game.
