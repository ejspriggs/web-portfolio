- As a friend of Edward, I'm curious about why he's been so busy lately and/or want to gas him up about something he's put time into.
- As a hiring manager, I want to see if this Spriggs guy is any good at web pages.
- As someone interested in playing games in a web browser, I have encountered a link to one of Edward's portfolio projects in the wild, and I want to play the game.
